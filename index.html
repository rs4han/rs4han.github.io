				<p>My name is Rachel and I built this website for you to get to know me professionally (and a little bit more personally), and for me to play around with websites. </p>

                <h2>Summary</h2>
				<p>Currently, I work at Deloitte in what can be referred to as techno-functional roles. It's similar to project management where I do lots of user requirement gathering, translating these into user stories for developers, strategy & risk analysis, and testing and validation for delivery. In short, I ensure that the business and technical sides communicate and understand each other for successful projects!<br> 
					<br>
				I have had the opportunity to work across industries from finances to food distribution, to health & life sciences. My heart remains in the latter, where I focus on how health & life science products can interact with best with patients.<br> <br>
