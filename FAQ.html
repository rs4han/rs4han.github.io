		<h1>(in)Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
		<h2>Why not do a one pager like the examples with Elon Musk and Bill Gates?</h2>
		<p>
			1pg resumes look amazing but they rely heavily on name recognition, so it's a different starting point. For
			example, even a two word resume like "started Amazon" is enough that I really want to work with that
			person!<br>
			Statements like that are awesome and heavy-hitting, but they also don't give you any details about how my
			skills or experience can be leveraged for specific positions. That's not to say I don't tailor and give out
			1pg-ers when I'm applying, but I thought it'd be nice to have a more general overview here and to share
			projects that I loved which are often left out of normal resumes.
		</p>
		<h2>So is this like a LinkedIn page without the benefits of LinkedIn? </h2>
		<p>
			Pretty much - if you like LinkedIn, I do have a link to mine in the footer. I built this
			webpage to give myself an opportunity to explore and to show others a different side of myself.
		</p>
		<h2>Is this website too plain? Where's your portfolio?</h2>
		<p>
			This isn't a portfolio, just an introduction. I purposely tried to keep everything to CSS and HTML. There
			are two reasons:
			<br>
			<b>a. Easy for you:</b> I wanted this to be quick and reliable to load on any browser, easy to navigate, and easy
			to flip through.
			<br>
			<b>b. Easy for me: </b>I wanted something near trivial to maintain, where I have full control, but still
			communicates my goal for even having a website. It's as touch-and-go for you, as it is for me.</p>
