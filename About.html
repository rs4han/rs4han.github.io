		<h1>About</h1>
		<p>Here I offer some informative, personal, and cute details about myself. Things like what I like to read ("If this is a Man" by Primo Levi), hobbies (like cooking or amateur bookbinding), and cool details (participating in a robot competition triggered my interest in engineering). <br> <br>

			<h2>(in)Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
			<p><b>

				Why not do a one pager like the examples with Elon Musk and Bill Gates?</b><br>
				1pg resumes look amazing but they rely heavily on name recognition, so it's a different starting point. For example, even a two word resume like "started Amazon" is enough that I really want to work with that person!<br>
				Statements like that are awesome and heavy-hitting, but they also don't give you any details about how my skills or experience can be leveraged for specific positions. That's not to say I don't tailor and give out 1pg-ers when I'm applying, but I thought it'd be nice to have a more general overview here and to share projects that I loved which are often left out of normal resumes.
				<br><b>
				So is this like a LinkedIn page without the benefits of LinkedIn? </b><br>
				Pretty much - depending on how much you like LinkedIn I do have a link to mine in the footer. I built this webpage to give myself an opportunity to explore and to show others a different side of myself.
				<br>
				<b>Is this website too plain? Where's your portfolio?</b><br>
				This isn't a portfolio, just an introduction. I purposely tried to keep everything to CSS and HTML. There are two reasons:
				<br>
				a. I wanted to keep this as simple as possible while accomplishing my goal for the reader: get to know me professionally and to get an idea of who I am personally.
				<br>
				b. I want it to be quick and reliable to load on any browser, easy to navigate and flip through, and trivial to maintain. It's touch-and-go for you, as it is for me.</p>
