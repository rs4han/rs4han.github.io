		<h1>About</h1>
		<p>I'm from Alberta, so to me, home is mountains and a clear sky so wide it feels like a windshield into the
			universe.
		</p>
		<p>
			However, the siren call of wanderlust can't be resisted and I am ceaselessly travelling. Some of my
			favourite places in the world (other than Canada) are California, Karnataka, and Holland - in no small part
			to the fantastic people there.
		</p>
		<p>
			On weekends and evenings I love socializing and cooking - often at the same time (prepare to work for your
			meal if I'm hosting!) - and rounding out my amateur artisan skill set.
		</p>
		<p>
			Finally, I am constantly reading. I especially love to read history (I will never get over the influence of
			WW2) and science fiction (what could come next?). Eventually, I'll share a reading list.
		</p>
		<p>
			Let's finish this with two truths and a lie:
		<ol>
			<li>A youth robotics competition triggered my interest in engineering.</li>
			<li>My favourite geological period is the Paleozoic Era.</li>
			<li>My longest backcountry hike was 6 days and I'm looking for more.</li>
		</ol>
		</p> <p style="padding-top: 1em;">
		<a href="#display_trivia" style="color: #5AA2AE"><b>Reveal the Lie</b></a>
		<span style="margin-top: auto;" id="display_trivia">The Mesozoic, not the Paleozoic, Era is everybody's favourite because that's when the dinosaurs governed the earth. </span></p>
