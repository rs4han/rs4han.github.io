                <p>I'll have to do things by hand at some point and it could be annoying.</p>
                <h2 id="Education">Education</h2>
                <p>2013-2018 <br>
                    University of Calgary, AB, CA <br>
                    BSc Electrical Engineering with a Biomedical Engineering Specialization <br>
                    and a minor in Entrepreneurship and Entreprise <br>
					</p>
				<h2 id="Work Experience">Work Experience</h2>
				<h3 id="WE Deloitte">Deloitte LLP</h3>
				<h4>Consultant, CAN, USA, Brazil</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Functional role to define user stories and process flow for the client and for the developers.</li>
					<li>Led demo sessions, UAT sessions, and solution walkthroughs for the client team.</li>
				</ul>


				<h3 id="WE Zephyr">Zephyr Sleep Technologies</h3>
				<h4>Product Development EIT (2016-2017)</h4>
				<p>
					Biomedical device startup based out of Calgary, Alberta, offering an innovative oral appliance therapy to sufferers of sleep apnea.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Extensive hardware testing and prototype development using C#</li>
						<li>Troubleshooting throughout clinical trials</li>
						<li>Hardware build of the interface bridge between trademark product and CPUs</li>
						<li>Wrote detailed medical product documentation for the Bill of Materials, and reports for the Departments of Quality Control, Product Development, Research, and Operations. Including support of FDA submission.</li>
					</ul>

				<h3>University Capstone Project</h3>
				<p>Our capstone team works together with the Alberta Children’s Hospital Research Institute to create an application for a new hand-held DNA sequencer called the MinION. Our algorithm identifies human DNA in real-time – and then throws it out! What’s left is invasive (such as virus, or viral) DNA. This sample could be used to help scientists identify the strain and characteristics of a virus; resulting in information that can estimate the spread of the virus and expedite the development of a vaccine. In rural areas like Guinea after the outbreak of Ebola, this process took weeks, but with our solution, it could just be a matter of hours.
				</p>
				
				<h3>TOM Makeathon</h3>
					<p>Participated in Calgary’s first TOM as the electrical lead. Teams worked with someone with a disability and created a solution to their lifestyle in 72 hrs. </p>
					<ul>
						<li>Served as electrical lead and designer using Arduino.</li>
						<li>Developed a tactile obstacle detection attachment to common ‘seeing sticks’, using sonar sensors to detect obstacles and translate the distance into haptic vibrations in the handle. The interval of vibration corellated to the distance of the obstacle.</li>
						<li>This solution is discreet for the user, and in addition to the way seeing sticks are commonly used, added another dimension of tactile obstacle detection.</li>
					</ul>
