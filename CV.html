			<p>I love working closely with my teams and have experience working remotely across multiple geographies with teams ranging from 6 to 50 people.
			</p><p>
				<b>Skills: </b>User stories and process workflow, user story requirement management, documentation, and agile (scrum) development framework. <br>
				<b>Languages: </b>Fluent English and French, Conversational Mandarin and Cantonese <br>
			</p>

			<h2 id="Education">Education</h2>
			<p>
				University of Calgary, AB, CA (2013-2018) <br>
				BSc Electrical Engineering with a Biomedical Engineering Specialization <br>
				and a minor in Entrepreneurship and Entreprise <br>
			</p>

			<h2 id="Work Experience">Work Experience</h2>
			<h3 id="Deloitte">Deloitte LLP</h3>
			<h4>Consultant, CAN, USA, Brazil (2019 - Present)</h4>
			<p>I perform techno-functional consulting roles, which is similar to project management. Essentially, I ensure that the business and technical sides communicate and understand each other for successful projects! This means lots of user requirements gathering, translating these into user stories for developers, strategy & risk analysis, and testing & validation for delivery. <br>

			To date, I have had the opportunity to work on nearly a dozen projects (sometimes simultaneously),
				across industries from finances to food distribution. However, my focus is on health & life sciences, where I
				work closely with partners to build products which supplement patient care, or interact directly with patients.</p>
			<b>Highlights</b>
			<ul>
				<li>Experience in both waterfall and agile development framework in roles as team member and scrum master. 
				</li>
				<li>Evaluated and defined user stories and process flow for the client and for the developers.
				</li>
				<li>Handled and analyzed current state data model and workflow to identify data weaknesses, duplication, or data dirtiness to design needs and process model changes.</li>
				<li>Designed and led patient usability testing, anlaysis, and presentation.</li>
				<li>Led demo sessions, UAT sessions, and solution walkthroughs for the client team.</li>
				<li>Quality assurance through writting hundreds of test scripts and testing for production. </li>
				<li>Managed remote teams across Canada, and including communication to tech teams in India.</li>
			</ul> 
			<p><b>Environments: </b>Salesforce, AWS, BluePrism, Jira</p>


			<h3 id="Zephyr">Zephyr Sleep Technologies</h3>
			<h4>Product Development EIT, Calgary, (2016-2017)</h4>
			<p>
				<a href="https://zephyrsleep.com/">Zephyr Sleep Tech</a> is a biomedical device startup, offering innovative oral appliance therapy as an alternative to CPAP to sufferers of sleep apnea.</p>
			<b>Highlights</b>
			<ul>
				<li>Extensive hardware testing and prototype development using C#.</li>
				<li>Troubleshooting throughout clinical trials.</li>
				<li>Hardware build of the interface bridge between trademark product and CPUs.</li>
				<li>Wrote detailed medical product documentation for the Bill of Materials, and reports for the
					Departments of Quality Control, Product Development, Research, and Operations.</li>
				<li>Included support of Health Canada and FDA submission.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2 id="DesignProjects">Design Projects</h2>

			<h3 id="UniversityCapstone">University Capstone Project (2018)</h3>
			<p>Our capstone team worked with the Alberta Children's Hospital Research Institute to build an application
				for the MinIon, a hand-held DNA sequencer. Our algorithm identified human DNA in real-time - and then throws it out! What's left is invasive (such as virus, or viral) DNA. This information could be used to	help scientists identify the strain and characteristics of a virus; resulting in information that can estimate the spread of the virus and expedite the development of a vaccine. <br>
				I had the opportunity to expand this project in a research thesis (detailed under <a
					href="#Publications">Publications</a>) evaluating the electrical response of DNA received by the MinION. <br>
					<a href="https://calgaryherald.com/news/local-news/schulich-school-of-engineering-students-unveil-visionary-projects">Calgary Herald mention of our project can be found here.</a>
			</p>

			<h3 id="RePlastic">RePlastic: A Plastical Solution (2016-2018)</h3>
			<p>I started the <a href="https://replasticyyc.wixsite.com/replastic">RePlastic</a> group out of the University of Calgary to build and experiment with Dave Hakken's <a href="https://preciousplastic.com/">"Precious Plastics"</a> maker designs. We aimed to create an open and creative plastic workshop for use at the
				University of Calgary. These machines are designed to turn plastic waste into useful raw resources.
				<br>
				We successfully built the shredder to break plastic up, and modelled the injector, which melts plastic into small molds. This project collaborated with local charities and even served as machine studies for student classes!
			</p>

			<h3 id="TOMMakeathon">TOM Makeathon (2015)</h3>
			<p>Participated in Calgary's first <a href="https://kadimadynamics.com/researchgroups/tom/">TOM Makeathon</a> as the electrical lead and designer using Arduino. Teams worked with a volunteer who faces a
				disability or challenge in their daily life. Together, we work together to design and build a solution
				to their chosen challenge within 72 hrs. </p>
			<ul>
				<li>Developed a tactile obstacle detection attachment to common "seeing sticks", using sonar sensors
					to detect obstacles and translate the distance into haptic vibrations in the handle. The interval
					of vibration corellated to the distance of the obstacle.</li>
				<li>This solution is discreet for the user, and in addition to the way seeing sticks are commonly
					used, added another dimension of tactile obstacle detection.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3 id="DIF">DIF Biomimicry Design Challenge (2014)</h3>
			<p><a href="https://www.thinkdif.co/">DIF</a> (Disruptive Innovation Festival) is a yearly global design festival dedicated to shifting mindsets and inspiring action towards a circular economy by sharing disruptive ideas and stories on a number of topics and attracts a worldwide audience, sparking critical conversations. <br> 
				<span style="font-size:smaller"> <b>Note:</b> DIF is now a part of the Ellen McArthur Foundation.</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>1st place winner 2014.</li>
				<li>Served as team lead in the research, design, and submission of GOOP (glutionous organic oxide-proof)
					packaging.</li>
			</ul>
