			<h1>Rachel Chan</h1>
			<p>This CV serves as an informal overview of my activities. If you are interested in further details or a more formalized resume, I would be happy to connect!</p>

			<h2 id="Education">Education</h2>
			<p>
				University of Calgary, AB, CA (2013-2018) <br>
				BSc Electrical Engineering with a Biomedical Engineering Specialization <br>
				and a minor in Entrepreneurship and Entreprise <br>
			</p>
			<h2 id="Work Experience">Work Experience</h2>
			<h3 id="WE Deloitte">Deloitte LLP</h3>
			<h4>Consultant, CAN, USA, Brazil (2019 - Present)</h4>
			<p>I perform techno-functional consulting roles, which is similar to project management. I ensure that the business and technical sides communicate and understand each other for successful projects! this means lots of user requirement gathering, translating these into user stories for developers, strategy & risk analysis, and testing and validation for delivery.  <br>

				To date, I have had the opportunity to work on 8 projects, across industries from finances to food distribution, to health & life sciences. My heart remains in the latter, where I focus on how health & life science products can interact with best with patients.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Functional role to define user stories and process flow for the client and for the developers.
				</li>
				<li>Handled and analyzed current state data model and workflow to identify data weaknesses,	duplication, or data dirtiness to design needs and process model changes.</li>
				<li>Designed and led patient usability testing, anlaysis, and presentation.</li>
				<li>Led demo sessions, UAT sessions, and solution walkthroughs for the client team.</li>
				<li>Managed remote teams, including communication to tech teams in India.</li>
			</ul>


			<h3 id="WE Zephyr">Zephyr Sleep Technologies</h3>
			<h4>Product Development EIT (2016-2017)</h4>
			<p>
				Biomedical device startup based out of Calgary, Alberta, offering an innovative oral appliance
				therapy
				to sufferers of sleep apnea.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Extensive hardware testing and prototype development using C#</li>
				<li>Troubleshooting throughout clinical trials</li>
				<li>Hardware build of the interface bridge between trademark product and CPUs</li>
				<li>Wrote detailed medical product documentation for the Bill of Materials, and reports for the	Departments of Quality Control, Product Development, Research, and Operations. Including support of FDA submission.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2 id="Design Projects">Design Projects</h2>
			<h3 id="University Capstone">University Capstone Project (2018)</h3>
			<p>Our capstone team worked with the Alberta Children's Hospital Research Institute to build an
				application
				for the MinIon, a hand-held DNA sequencer. Our algorithm identified human DNA in real-time - and
				then
				throws it out! What's left is invasive (such as virus, or viral) DNA. This information could be used
				to
				help scientists identify the strain and characteristics of a virus; resulting in information that
				can
				estimate the spread of the virus and expedite the development of a vaccine.
			</p>

			<h3 id="TOM Makethon">TOM Makeathon (2015)</h3>
			<p>Participated in Calgary's first TOM as the electrical lead. Teams worked with someone with a
				disability
				and created a solution to their lifestyle in 72 hrs. </p>
			<ul>
				<li>Served as electrical lead and designer using Arduino.</li>
				<li>Developed a tactile obstacle detection attachment to common "seeing sticks", using sonar sensors
					to
					detect obstacles and translate the distance into haptic vibrations in the handle. The interval
					of
					vibration corellated to the distance of the obstacle.</li>
				<li>This solution is discreet for the user, and in addition to the way seeing sticks are commonly
					used,
					added another dimension of tactile obstacle detection.</li>
			</ul>
