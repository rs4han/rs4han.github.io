			<h2>Rachel Chan</h2>
			<p>This CV serves as an informal overview of my activities. If you are interested in further details or a
				more formalized resume, I would be happy to connect!</p>
			
			<h2 id="Summary">Summary</h2>
			<p>
				<b>Skills: </b>User stories and process workflow, user story requirement management, documentation, and agile (scrum) development framework. I love working closely with my teams and have experience working remotely across multiple geographies with teams ranging from 6 to 50 people. <br>
				<b>Languages: </b>Fluent English and French, Conversational Mandarin and Cantonese <br>
			</p>

			<h2 id="Education">Education</h2>
			<p>
				University of Calgary, AB, CA (2013-2018) <br>
				BSc Electrical Engineering with a Biomedical Engineering Specialization <br>
				and a minor in Entrepreneurship and Entreprise <br>
			</p>

			<h2 id="Work Experience">Work Experience</h2>
			<h3 id="WE Deloitte">Deloitte LLP</h3>
			<h4>Business Technology Analyst, CAN, USA, Brazil (2019 - Present)</h4>
			<p>I perform techno-functional consulting roles, which is similar to project management and then a little more. Mainly, I ensure that the business and technical sides communicate and understand each other for successful projects! This means lots of user requirement gathering, translating these into user stories for developers, strategy & risk analysis, and testing and validation for delivery. <br>

			To date, I have had the opportunity to work on nearly a dozen projects (sometimes simultaneously),
				across industries from finances to food distribution, but my focus is on health & life sciences, where I
				work closely with partners to build product which supplement patient care, or interact directly with them.</p>
			<b>Highlights</b>
			<ul>
				<li>Experience in both waterfall and agile development framework in roles as team member and scrum master. 
				</li>
				<li>Functional role to define user stories and process flow for the client and for the developers.
				</li>
				<li>Handled and analyzed current state data model and workflow to identify data weaknesses, duplication, or data dirtiness to design needs and process model changes.</li>
				<li>Designed and led patient usability testing, anlaysis, and presentation.</li>
				<li>Led demo sessions, UAT sessions, and solution walkthroughs for the client team.</li>
				<li>Quality assurance through writting hundreds of test scripts and testing for production. </li>
				<li>Managed remote teams across Canada, and including communication to tech teams in India.</li>
			</ul> 
			<p><b>Environments: </b>Salesforce, AWS, BluePrism, Jira</p>


			<h3 id="WE Zephyr">Zephyr Sleep Technologies</h3>
			<h4>Product Development EIT (2016-2017)</h4>
			<p>
				Biomedical device startup based out of Calgary, Alberta, offering an innovative oral appliance therapy to sufferers of sleep apnea.</p>
			<b>Highlights</b>
			<ul>
				<li>Extensive hardware testing and prototype development using C#</li>
				<li>Troubleshooting throughout clinical trials</li>
				<li>Hardware build of the interface bridge between trademark product and CPUs</li>
				<li>Wrote detailed medical product documentation for the Bill of Materials, and reports for the
					Departments of Quality Control, Product Development, Research, and Operations. Including support of
					FDA submission.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2 id="Design Projects">Design Projects</h2>



			<h3 id="University Capstone">University Capstone Project (2018)</h3>
			<p>Our capstone team worked with the Alberta Children's Hospital Research Institute to build an application
				for the MinIon, a hand-held DNA sequencer. Our algorithm identified human DNA in real-time - and
				then
				throws it out! What's left is invasive (such as virus, or viral) DNA. This information could be used
				to
				help scientists identify the strain and characteristics of a virus; resulting in information that
				can
				estimate the spread of the virus and expedite the development of a vaccine. <br>
				I had the opportunity to expand this project in a research thesis (detailed under <a
					href="#Publications">Publications</a>) evaluating the electrical response of DNA received by the
				MinION.
			</p>

			<h3 id="Replastic">RePlastic: A Plastical Solution (2016-2018)</h3>
			<p>I started a group out of the University of Calgary to build and experiment with Dave Hakken's "Precious
				Plastic" maker designs. We aimed to create an open and creative plastic workshop for use at the
				University of Calgary. These machines are designed to turn plastic waste into useful raw resources.
				<br>
				We successfully built the shredder to break plastic up, and modelled the injector, which melts plastic
				into small molds.
				<br>
				This project collaborated with local charities and even served as machine studies for student classes!
			</p>

			<h3 id="TOM Makethon">TOM Makeathon (2015)</h3>
			<p>Participated in Calgary's first TOM as the electrical lead. Teams worked with a volunteer who faces a
				disability or challenge in their daily life. Together, we work together to design and build a solution
				to their chosen challenge within 72 hrs. </p>
			<ul>
				<li>Served as electrical lead and designer using Arduino.</li>
				<li>Developed a tactile obstacle detection attachment to common "seeing sticks", using sonar sensors
					to
					detect obstacles and translate the distance into haptic vibrations in the handle. The interval
					of
					vibration corellated to the distance of the obstacle.</li>
				<li>This solution is discreet for the user, and in addition to the way seeing sticks are commonly
					used,
					added another dimension of tactile obstacle detection.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3 id="DIF">DIF Biomimicry Design Challenge (2014)</h3>
			<p>DIF (Disruptive Innovation Festival) is a yearly global design festival. Note: DIF is now a part of the
				Ellen McArthur Foundation.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>1st place winner 2014</li>
				<li>Served as team lead in the research, design, and submission of GOOP (glutionous organic oxide-proof)
					packaging </li>
			</ul>
